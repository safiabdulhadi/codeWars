//Total amount of points
/*
Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings.
 Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y",
  where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.
For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Points are awarded for each match as follows:

if x > y: 3 points (win)
if x < y: 0 points (loss)
if x = y: 1 point (tie)
We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns
the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.

Notes:

our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
0 <= x <= 4
0 <= y <= 4
